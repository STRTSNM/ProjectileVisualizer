# ProjectileVisualizer
A simple python program written in pure python to visualize the trajectory of a projectile.

Note : The variable "accuracy" is the variable which determines the accuracy of the path drawn. Lower the the value, better is the accuracy of the path. But note that lower value also means more time taken to visualize.

Enjoy!!
